## Intro

Howdy, I'm Warren Halderman and here's what I spend most of my time with:
- TypeScript/JavaScript (+ CSS + HTML on the front end)
- Clickhouse
- Redis
- Node.js
- Docker
- Kubernetes

Languages I've used but am not an expert in:
- C++ (I started here, but never used it professionally)
- Rust
- Python
- Java (not a big fan, but still need to check out Scala)

Languages I'd like to use more often:
- Rust (the executable efficiency is attractive)
- Go (the executable + developer efficiency is attractive)

I currently live in Japan 🇯🇵 helping the teams at [__ブルースクレイ・ジャパン株式会社__][200] (Bruce Clay Japan, Inc.).  
I'm married to a wonderfully kind wife, Itsuka.  
I practice photography and keep a record over at [rasterpiece.gallery][9001].  
I enjoy practicing martial arts.  
I'd like to own a ranch and do some back-breaking labor.
